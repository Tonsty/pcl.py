class MedianFilter(Filter):
    '''
    Implementation of the median filter.

    The median filter is one of the simplest and wide-spread image processing filters. It is known
    to perform well with "shot"/impulse noise (some individual pixels having extreme values), it
    does not reduce contrast across steps in the function (as compared to filters based on
    averaging), and it is robust to outliers. Furthermore, it is simple to implement and efficient,
    as it requires a single pass over the image. It consists of a moving window of fixed size that
    replaces the pixel in the center with the median inside the window.

    This algorithm filters only the depth (z-component) of **organized** and untransformed
    (i.e., in camera coordinates) point clouds. An error will be outputted if an unorganized cloud
    is given to the class instance.
