# PyPCL [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cmpute/pypcl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cmpute/pypcl)

Re-implementation in pure python of Point Cloud Library (PCL)

## Principles
Implement a easy-using python library to process point cloud, combined with scipy and numpy. It can helps you get rid of the problems of linking various C++ libraries and the long waiting compiling process . The interfaces of PCL are also cleaned and simplified for handy using.

Nevertheless, this library focused on simplicity, readability and accessibility, speed performance may be sacrified when developing. Code optimizing is not conducted generally, and compared to MATLAB and C++, the library can be a bit slower in some cases.

------------------------

## Compatibility
- Written in Python 3
- Tested on Python 3.5, Numpy>=1.10 (Temporarily)

------------------------

## Notes
The library is under heavy construction, thus do not use it in productive codes. However, playing with it is totally welcome now, and it will be great to receive your issues, suggestions and pull requests!~
